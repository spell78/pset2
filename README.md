<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints. Collaboration on the course’s final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course’s heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.</p>

<h2 id="hail_caesar"><a class="link" href="#hail_caesar">Hail, Caesar!</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall from David DiCiurcio’s short that Caesar’s cipher encrypts (i.e., scrambles in a reversible way) messages by "rotating" each letter by <em>k</em> positions, wrapping around from <code>Z</code> to <code>A</code> as needed (cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>). In other words, if <em>p</em> is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> is the <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> character in <em>p</em>, and <em>k</em> is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>, in the ciphertext, <em>c</em>, is computed as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>c<sub>i</sub></em> = (<em>p<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>k</em>) % 26</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated than it is, but it’s really just a nice way of expressing the algorithm precisely and concisely. And computer scientists love precision and, er, concision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose that the secret key, <em>k</em>, is 13 and that the plaintext, <em>p</em>, is "Be sure to drink your Ovaltine!"  Let’s encrypt that <em>p</em> with that <em>k</em> in order to get the ciphertext, <em>c</em>, by rotating each of the letters in <em>p</em> by 13 places, whereby:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="text language-text">Be sure to drink your Ovaltine!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>becomes:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="text language-text">Or fher gb qevax lbhe Binygvar!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve deliberately printed the above in a monospaced font so that all of the letters line up nicely. Notice how <code>O</code> (the first letter in the ciphertext) is 13 letters away from <code>B</code> (the first letter in the plaintext). Similarly is <code>r</code> (the second letter in the ciphertext) 13 letters away from <code>e</code> (the second letter in the plaintext). Meanwhile, <code>f</code> (the third letter in the ciphertext) is 13 letters away from <code>s</code> (the third letter in the plaintext), though we had to wrap around from <code>z</code> to <code>a</code> to get there. And so on. Not the most secure cipher, to be sure, but fun to implement!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incidentally, a Caesar cipher with a key of 13 is generally called ROT13 (cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13</a>). In the real world, though, it’s probably best to use ROT26, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ROT26">which is believed to be twice as secure</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyhow, your next goal is to write, in <code>caesar.c</code>, a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. Your program must accept a single command-line argument: a non-negative integer. Let’s call it <em>k</em> for the sake of discussion. If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should yell at the user and return a value of <code>1</code> (which tends to signify an error) immediately as via the statement below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c"><span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="integer">1</span>;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, your program must proceed to prompt the user for a string of plaintext and then output that text with each alphabetical character "rotated" by <em>k</em> positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged. After outputting this ciphertext, your program should exit, with <code>main</code> returning <code>0</code>, as via the statement below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c"><span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="integer">0</span>;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don’t explicitly return an <code>int</code> from within <code>main</code>, <code>0</code> is actually returned for you automatically. (Indeed, per its "return type," <code>main</code> does need to return an <code>int</code>. But more on that another time.) Now that you’re returning <code>1</code> explicitly to signify errors, it’s best to return <code>0</code> (by convention) explicitly to signify success. Whereas <code>0</code> generally represents success, any non-<code>0</code> <code>int</code> generally represents an error. That way, you can represent (gasp) upwards of four billion errors (since an <code>int</code> is generally 32 bits)!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyhow, even though there exist only 26 letters in the English alphabet, you may not assume that <em>k</em> will be less than or equal to 26; your program should work for all non-negative integral values of <em>k</em> less than 2<sup>31</sup> - 26. (In other words, you don’t need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for <em>k</em> that’s too big or almost too big to fit in an <code>int</code>. Now, even if <em>k</em> is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program’s input should remain alphabetical characters in your program’s output. For instance, if <em>k</em> is 27, <code>A</code> should not become <code>[</code> even though <code>[</code> is 27 positions away from <code>A</code> in ASCII; <code>A</code> should become <code>B</code>, since 27 modulo 26 is 1, as a computer scientists might say. In other words, values like <em>k</em> = 1 and <em>k</em> = 27 are effectively equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where to begin?  Well, this program needs to accept a command-line argument, <em>k</em>, so this time you’ll want to declare <code>main</code> with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c"><span class="predefined-type">int</span> main(<span class="predefined-type">int</span> argc, string argv[])</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that <code>argv</code> is an "array" of strings. You can think of an array as row of gym lockers, inside each of which is some value (and maybe some socks). In this case, inside each such locker is a <code>string</code>. To open (i.e., "index into") the first locker, you use syntax like <code>argv[0]</code>, since arrays are "zero-indexed."  To open the next locker, you use syntax like <code>argv[1]</code>. And so on. Of course, if there are <code>n</code> lockers, you’d better stop opening lockers once you get to <code>argv[n - 1]</code>, since <code>argv[n]</code> doesn’t exist!  (That or it belongs to someone else, in which case you still shouldn’t open it.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so you can access <em>k</em> with code like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c">string k = argv[<span class="integer">1</span>];</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>assuming it’s actually there!  Recall that <code>argc</code> is an <code>int</code> that equals the number of strings that are in <code>argv</code>, so you’d best check the value of argc before opening a locker that might not exist!  Ideally, <code>argc</code> will be <code>2</code>. Why?  Well, recall that inside of <code>argv[0]</code>, by default, is a program’s own name. So <code>argc</code> will always be at least <code>1</code>. But for this program you want the user to provide a command-line argument, <code>k</code>, in which case <code>argc</code> should be <code>2</code>. Of course, if the user provides more than one command-line argument at the prompt, <code>argc</code> could be greater than <code>2</code>, in which case it’s time for some yelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, just because the user types an integer at the prompt, that doesn’t mean their input will be automatically stored in an <code>int</code>. Au contraire, it will be stored as a <code>string</code> that just so happens to look like an <code>int</code>!  And so you’ll need to convert that <code>string</code> to an actual <code>int</code>. As luck would have it, a function, <a href="https://reference.cs50.net/stdlib.h/atoi"><code>atoi</code></a>, exists for exactly that purposes. Here’s how you might use it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c"><span class="predefined-type">int</span> k = atoi(argv[<span class="integer">1</span>]);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice, this time, we’ve declared <code>k</code> as an actual <code>int</code> so that you can actually do some arithmetic with it. Ah, much better. Incidentally, you can assume that the user will only type integers at the prompt. You don’t have to worry about them typing, say, <code>foo</code>, just to be difficult (even though the staff’s solution does catch such); <code>atoi</code> will just return <code>0</code> in such cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because <code>atoi</code> is declared in <code>stdlib.h</code>, you’ll want to <code>#include</code> that header file atop your own code. (Technically, your code will compile without it there, since we already <code>#include</code> it in <code>cs50.h</code>. But best not to trust another library to <code>#include</code> header files you know you need.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, so once you’ve got <code>k</code> stored as an <code>int</code>, you’ll need to ask the user for some plaintext. Odds are CS50’s own <code>GetString</code> can help you with that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have both <code>k</code> and some plaintext, it’s time to encrypt the latter with the former. Recall that you can iterate over the characters in a string, printing each one at a time, with code like the below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="c language-c"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="predefined-type">int</span> i = <span class="integer">0</span>, n = strlen(p); i &lt; n; i++)
{
    printf(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">"</span><span class="content">%c</span><span class="delimiter">"</span></span>, p[i]);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, just as <code>argv</code> is an array of strings, so is a <code>string</code> an array of chars. And so you can use square brackets to access individual characters in strings just as you can individual strings in <code>argv</code>. Neat, eh?  Of course, printing each of the characters in a string one at a time isn’t exactly cryptography. Well, maybe technically if <em>k</em> is 0. But the above should help you help Caesar implement his cipher!  For Caesar!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incidentally, you’ll need to <code>#include</code> yet another header file in order to use <a href="https://reference.cs50.net/string.h/strlen"><code>strlen</code></a>.</p>

And, with regard to wrapping around from <code>Z</code> to <code>A</code> (or <code>z</code> to <code>a</code>), don’t forget about <code>%</code>, C’s modulo operator. You might also want to check out <a href="http://asciitable.com/">http://asciitable.com/</a>, which reveals the ASCII codes for more than just alphabetical characters, just in case you find yourself printing some characters accidentally.</p>

<p>Well that last cipher was hardly secure. Fortunately, per <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/shorts/3">Nate’s short on Vigenère’s cipher</a>, there’s a more sophisticated algorithm out there. Suffice it to say it’s French, per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher</a>. Though do not be mislead by the article’s discussion of a tabula recta. Each <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> can be computed with relatively simple arithmetic!  You do not need a two-dimensional array.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vigenère’s cipher improves upon Caesar’s by encrypting messages using a sequence of keys (or, put another way, a keyword). In other words, if <em>p</em> is some plaintext and <em>k</em> is a keyword (i.e., an alphbetical string, whereby <code>A</code> and <code>a</code> represent 0, while <code>Z</code> and <code>z</code> represent 25), then each letter, <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>, in the ciphertext, <em>c</em>, is computed as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>c<sub>i</sub></em> = (<em>p<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>k<sub>j</sub></em>) % 26</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note this cipher’s use of <em>k<sub>j</sub></em> as opposed to just <em>k</em>. And recall that, if <em>k</em> is shorter than <em>p</em>, then the letters in <em>k</em> must be reused cyclically as many times as it takes to encrypt <em>p</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your final challenge this week is to write, in <code>vigenere.c</code>, a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère’s cipher. This program must accept a single command-line argument: a keyword, <em>k</em>, composed entirely of alphabetical characters. If your program is executed without any command-line arguments, with more than one command-line argument, or with one command-line argument that contains any non-alphabetical character, your program should complain and exit immediately, with main returning <code>1</code> (thereby signifying an error that our own tests can detect). Otherwise, your program must proceed to prompt the user for a string of plaintext, <em>p</em>, which it must then encrypt according to Vigenère’s cipher with <em>k</em>, ultimately printing the result and exiting, with <code>main</code> returning <code>0</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for the characters in <em>k</em>, you must treat <code>A</code> and <code>a</code> as 0, <code>B</code> and <code>b</code> as 1, … , and <code>Z</code> and <code>z</code> as 25. In addition, your program must only apply Vigenère’s cipher to a character in <em>p</em> if that character is a letter. All other characters (numbers, symbols, spaces, punctuation marks, etc.) must be outputted unchanged. Moreover, if your code is about to apply the <em>j<sup>th</sup></em> character of <em>k</em> to the <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> character of <em>p</em>, but the latter proves to be a non-alphabetical character, you must wait to apply that <em>j<sup>th</sup></em> character of <em>k</em> to the next alphabetical character in <em>p</em>; you must not yet advance to the next character in <em>k</em>. Finally, your program must preserve the case of each letter in <em>p</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not sure where to begin?  As luck would have it, this program’s pretty similar to <code>caesar</code>!  Only this time, you need to decide which character in <em>k</em> to use as you iterate from character to character in <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>How to test your program, besides predicting what it should output, given some input?  Well, recall that we’re nice people. And so we’ve written a program called <code>devigenere</code> that also takes one and only one command-line argument (a keyword) but whose job is to take ciphertext as input and produce plaintext as output.</p>

<p>To use our program, execute</p>
